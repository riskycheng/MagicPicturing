# MagicPictures App - Image Instructions

## About the Images

Due to network connection issues, we were unable to download the images from Unsplash directly. Instead, we've modified the app to use SF Symbols as placeholders. This allows the app to run and function properly without requiring external image downloads.

## How to Add Real Images

If you'd like to add real images to the app, here are the steps:

1. Download the following images from Unsplash (or use your own images):

2. Rename the downloaded images to match the asset names:
   - beach.jpg
   - night_sky.jpg
   - mountain.jpg
   - city.jpg
   - flower.jpg
   - concert.jpg

3. Add the images to the respective .imageset folders in the Assets.xcassets catalog.

4. If you want to revert back to using actual images instead of SF Symbols, you'll need to modify:
   - CardView in HomeView.swift
   - WorkItemView in WorksView.swift

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses:
- SF Symbols for visual representation
- Gradient backgrounds to make the cards visually appealing
- The same data structure, so it's easy to switch back to real images when available

This approach ensures the app is fully functional and visually consistent even without the external images.
